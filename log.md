### Day 1: 2019-12-15

**Today's Progress** Have decided to go for a robot that monitors a directory and then upload to FTP if a file is added.

**Thoughts:** First I need to monitor a directory of choice and report to me if something changes. It then connects to a FTP Server and upload files that have been added.

### Day 5: 2019-12-19

**Today's Progress** We started with doing some pseudocode for beginners and I figured out what my robot should do. We then made .GitIgnore and that hides my credentials so others cant hack me and see my details. We played a litlle around with Git and how Visual Studio Code can do commits from the menu. 

**Thoughts:** I think I got some momentum build up and looking forward to tommorrow and learning more and more.
