### Day 1: December 15, 2019

**Today's Progress** Have decided to go for a robot that monitors a directory and then upload to FTP if a file is added.

**Thoughts:** First I need to monitor a directory of choice and report to me if something changes. It then connects to a FTP Server and upload files that have been added.
